# react-conFusion

## About the Project

This project is the upgraded version of the bootstrap-conFusion website created by me.
This contains the source code for a small restaurant website that I've made, which enables the users to access the home page, dishes, about the restaurant and the contact us pages! It also provides the facility to log in as a verified user or sign up. The dishes page also includes a form allowing users to submit their ratings and reviews for any particular dish or dishes.
ConFusion is a front-end website which has a user friendly interface that will enable you to explore the details of the 'Ristorane del conFusion! I have made the use of some of the most prominent and versatile tools out there to make it as user friendly as possible.

This is my first hands-on experience with creating a website using ReactJS library. The main motive of this website for me was to learn the concepts of web development from the perspective of a front-end web developer. There are a lot of modifications that I need to make on this website. This project is a step towards the journey of being a full-stack web-developer. I will keep updating this project via different repositories while I keep learning new tools and skills!
